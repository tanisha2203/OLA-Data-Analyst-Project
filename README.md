# 🚖 OLA Data Analyst Project Power BI & SQL

The OLA Data Analyst Project analyzes ride-booking data using SQL and Power BI to track ride volumes, customer behavior, and driver performance. It focuses on booking statuses, revenue breakdowns by payment method, and top customers. SQL queries are used to calculate ride statistics, and the final Power BI dashboard visualizes key data, including ride volumes, vehicle performance, and sales. The analysis helps optimize OLA's services by identifying trends and areas for improvement.

# 🚖 OLA Data Analyst Project SQL

## 📂 Introduction to the Database

This project involves analyzing ride bookings data for a ride-hailing service, "OLA." The database contains various tables (e.g., `bookings`, `customers`, and `drivers`) that store information about ride bookings, customer ratings, driver ratings, vehicle types, payment methods, and more.

The main objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights and statistics using SQL queries. This document showcases a set of queries to answer specific analytical questions about the business performance and customer behavior.

### 🛠️ How the Database Works

- **📊 Tables**: The database is primarily focused on the `bookings` table, which contains the following key columns:

  - `Booking_ID`: Unique identifier for each ride.
  - `Customer_ID`: ID of the customer who booked the ride.
  - `Vehicle_Type`: Type of vehicle used (e.g., Prime Sedan, Auto, etc.).
  - `Booking_Status`: Status of the ride (e.g., `Success`, `Cancelled by Customer`, etc.).
  - `Ride_Distance`: Distance covered in the ride (in kilometers).
  - `Payment_Method`: Mode of payment used for the ride (e.g., UPI, Card, Cash).
  - `Driver_Ratings`: Ratings provided by customers to the drivers (out of 5).
  - `Customer_Rating`: Ratings provided by drivers to the customers (out of 5).
  - `Booking_Value`: Monetary value of the completed ride.
  - `Incomplete_Rides`: A flag to indicate whether the ride was completed or not.
  - `Incomplete_Rides_Reason`: If the ride was incomplete, this column stores the reason.

- **🔍 Views**: This document includes SQL `CREATE VIEW` statements to predefine specific datasets and make querying simpler for repetitive tasks.

- **📈 Key Insights**: Using SQL, we retrieve data that helps us answer questions such as:
  - The top-performing customers.
  - Average ratings and distances.
  - Trends in cancellations by drivers and customers.
  - The total revenue from successful rides.

## 🏗️ Database Setup

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Ola;
USE Ola;
```

## 📂 Importing Data into MySQL Workbench

To work with the database, we first need to import the data from the `bookings.csv` file into MySQL Workbench. Follow these steps:

1. **Open MySQL Workbench**:

   - Launch MySQL Workbench and connect to your database server.

2. **Select the Database**:

   - Use the `Ola` database by running:
     ```sql
     USE Ola;
     ```

3. **Go to the Import Section**:

   - Click on the "Server" menu and select "Data Import."

4. **Choose the CSV File**:

   - In the "Import" tab, choose the `bookings.csv` file as the source.
   - Ensure the "Import Data from File" option is selected.

5. **Map the Table**:

   - Select the destination table (`bookings`).
   - Map the CSV columns to the corresponding table columns.

6. **Run the Import**:

   - Click on "Start Import."

7. **Verify the Data**:
   - After importing, verify the data using:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM bookings LIMIT 10;
     ```
